# Research on the implementation of symbolic solvers to support iterative methods for solving numerical problems

The investigations presented here were carried out as part of a position as a student assistant at the Berlin University of Applied Sciences ([BHT](https://www.bht-berlin.de/)) for [Department II](https://www.bht-berlin.de/ii). The aim is to find out whether an application of symbolic solvers, specifically by Sympy, to support numerical calculations in Python is accompanied by a computational effort that is acceptable in terms of time.

The report on the investigations is only available in German so far, but an automatic translation can be viewed at this link.
